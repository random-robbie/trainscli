# trainscli
View train times in real-time in your console


Alter WKI for the station code of your location station and it should print the times for you.

i've forked this from mattshirtliffe/trainscli

altered it only slightly to remove an error from BS moaning about the type of data to parse and removed whitespace on print out.
